> Last update: 19 April 2024

This Privacy Policy outlines how user data is handled by the "Send WhatsApp" Chrome extension ("Extension") when you use it to interact with the WhatsApp API. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

**Information We Collect**

The Extension does not collect or store any user data. It does not track or record any information about your browsing activity, usage patterns, or personal information.

**Use of WhatsApp API**

The Extension utilizes the WhatsApp API solely for the purpose of facilitating communication by allowing users to open a chat window for a given phone number directly in WhatsApp Web or the WhatsApp desktop application. The Extension does not access or retrieve any data from WhatsApp conversations or interactions.

**Third-Party Services**

The Extension may interact with WhatsApp's services through its API. We do not control how WhatsApp handles user data, and users are encouraged to review WhatsApp's own privacy policy for information on how their data is processed.

**Security**

We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of the Extension and any data transmitted through it. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page.
